1. It can not decrypt the same message we encrypted. 
It happens because if m is bigger than n, when decrypt the message, m^ed % n = m % n, but m is bigger than n, so the final answer should be other numbers instead of m, which leads to a different message other than m. 
Cyptosystems uses hash functions(MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 SHA-3, etc) to deal with large documents  which m > n.

2. The ciphertexts are exactly the same. 
In this way, every time you send the same message, the m^d stays the same.
Under the case that only encrypting one of two messages:"0" or "1â€œ(boolean), if the key stays the same, the attacker can know which message corresponds to which m^d, and then able to be in the middle of the line, intercepting the message people send out, and pretend to be the sender and send messages out to the other person.
Think like man in the middle???
